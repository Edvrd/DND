            <h1>Artificer: Alchemist</h1>

            <p><strong>An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility has long been valued during times of war and peace.</strong></p>

            <h2>Tool Proficiency</h2>
            <p>When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>

            <h2>Alchemist Spells</h2>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.</p>
            <table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Artificer Level</th>

        <h2>Experimental Elixir</h2>
        <p>At 3rd level, you can create an experimental elixir with alchemist's supplies. As an action, you can touch a creature and administer the elixir. Roll a d6 to determine the elixir's effect, which lasts for 1 hour. The elixir loses its potency if you don't use it within 1 hour of creating it. You can create a number of elixirs equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

                <h2>Alchemical Savant</h2>
        <p>At 5th level, you've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>

        <h2>Restorative Reagents</h2>
        <p>Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).</li>
            <li>You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Mastery</h2>
        <p>By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.</li>
            <li>You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.</li>

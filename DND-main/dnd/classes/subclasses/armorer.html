            <h1>Artificer: Armorer</h1>

            <p><strong>An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.</strong></p>

            <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
            <p>When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>

            <h2>Armorer Spells</h2>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.</p>

        <h2>Arcane Armor</h2>
        <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.<br><br>
You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>
    <li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>
    <li>The armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.</li>
    <li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.</p>
<h2>Armor model</h2>
<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.<br><br>

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.<br><br>

You can change the armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.</p>

                <h2>Alchemical Savant</h2>
        <p>At 5th level, you've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>

        <h2>Restorative Reagents</h2>
        <p>Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).</li>
            <li>You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Mastery</h2>
        <p>By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.</li>
            <li>You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus.

<p><strong>Your patrons is not an entity in the conventional mater of the word, but in the collective knowledge of reality and that can and will happen. It could be a story told you by an old man with unsettling detail of what's going to pass, a book containing every single text ever written which pages now blank burn themselves in your subconscious and are now slowly leaking into the conscious, or maybe you have seen the giant figures looming over you narrating itself narrating itself but for a split second tho that was enough for you to feel the narratives tug.</strong></p>

<h3>It speaks to me things to come</h3>
<p>At 1 level, visions and memories of things yet to come or which already happened show themselves to you. at the start of every sesion, the dm privately tells you: a story beat they feel will happen within this or the next session, a past event important to the story or current events, a fundamental truth about is world, or deep secret about one of your companions. You cannot reveal this information directly ( you can do so inderectly if you please ) to anyone. The amount of information given to you by the dm is equal to halve your proficiency modifier rounded up. </p>

<h3>I should not know this, why do I know this???</h3>
<p>At 1 level, remembering things comes to you easily, even things you've never learned.... And +1 to every intelligence and wisdom check to recall or extrapolate information. you may make intelligence or wisdom checks to recall information not known to you, tho you do so at disadvantage. </p>

<h3>Your nature, shown, unraveled</h3>
<p>At 6 level, your foes learn how painful it is to be truly known. 
As a bonus action you can force a creature within 40ft and visible to you to make a constitution saving throw ( your spellcasting DC ) on a failure you rip out a pic of creatures being immediately learning one of the following: all of the creatures damage and condition resistances, immunities and weaknesses; all of the creatures abilities scores and saving throws; a creatures name, age, creature type and alignment; one of the creatures actions or legendary actions ( from to to bottom, this can be repeated until you know all of it's actions and legendary actions ); , and deal 1d4 force damage for every bit of information from the selection above yet unknown to you.</p>
<h3>a mind this full can not be read </h3>
<p>At 10 level, the amount of information coursing through your mind is actively harmful to mind readers. When a creature friendly or not tires to read your mind or access your memory in anyway takes 5d6 psychic damage and cannot use whatever feature or spell it  used to do this until the next long rest 
</p>

<h3>it only speaks when asked</h3>
<p>At 10 level, you subconscious sometimes sprouts truths and trivia from your lips unbeknownst to there owner. When asked a question you can ask the dm to answer it truthfully for you with an adequate amount of detail, you can use this feature twice before needing to rest.</p>
<h3>T̛̍̀͡H̴̠̽͋͘E̴̫̲͚̜̐̌̔̀ͨ F̼̰̔̄͋L̲̩̆͆ͬO͔ODGATE̜S̩͑̐̓͡ A͂RȄ̸͉̓͆͟ OPͬ̾̔͝EÑ</h3>
<p>At 14 level you can open the gates of your mind flooding infinite knowledge into the perception of anyone around. As a action you create a 80ft sphere centered on you lasting until the start of your next turn and are paralysed, any creature within it at the moment of it's creation, starting or ending it's turn within the sphere make a intelligence saving throw ( your spellcasting DC ) on a failure they take 3d10 psychic damage, learn one thing from the "it speaks to me things" table and are incapacitated taking half damage on a success, during it's turn it can attempt to retake it's save taking 1d10 psychic dmg on a failure and ending it's paralysed condition on a success. This feature can only be used once per long rest.
